# Parse go.mod entry for `github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit`. Construct
# and output ctk container image locator corresponding to that.

# The image locator is meant for consumption at DRA driver container image build
# time (passed into the build as build argument). Currently used to read the
# `nvidia-cdi-hook` binary from the toolkits container image.
#
# Distinguish two cases:
#
# - Format 'vX.Y.Z-time-commit': use ghcr.io with commit SHA (dev builds)
# - Format 'vX.Y.Z'            : use nvcr.io (releases)
#
# Assume consumption via `$(shell ...)` which ignores the exit code. Indicate
# result on stdout:
#
#  - Success: emit URL on stdout
#  - Failure: emit TOOLKIT_VERSION_NOT_SET or TOOLKIT_VERSION_PARSE_FAILED.
#
# May fail in some environments that do not have Golang tooling in their PATH.
# Currently executed upon including `versions.mk`, i.e. for all targets. Hence,
# do not emit errors on `stderr`, but gracefully degrade (many Makefile targets
# powered by versions.mk still work correctly with TOOLKIT_VERSION_NOT_SET).
